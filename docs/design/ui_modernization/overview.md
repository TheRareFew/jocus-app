# UI Modernization Overview

## Implementation Order & Dependencies

1. **Material 3 Migration (Foundation)**
   - Base UI framework update
   - Required for all subsequent UI changes
   - Already partially implemented in some widgets
   - Timeline: Sprint 1-2

2. **AutoRoute Migration (Navigation)**
   - Type-safe routing implementation
   - Dependent on Material 3 for consistent navigation transitions
   - Timeline: Sprint 2-3

3. **State Management Refinement (Hybrid Approach)**
   - Keep Provider for app-wide simple state (Auth)
   - Implement BLoC for complex feature states
   - Timeline: Sprint 3-4

4. **Creator Tools & Maintenance (Ongoing)**
   - Gradual implementation after foundation is solid
   - Performance optimization
   - UX improvements
   - Timeline: Ongoing

## Dependencies & Conflicts Resolution

- Material 3 must be implemented first as other UI changes depend on it
- AutoRoute implementation should precede state management changes for cleaner navigation code
- State management will use a hybrid approach to minimize refactoring while maximizing benefits
- Creator tools improvements can be implemented gradually as they don't have direct dependencies

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Material 3 Foundation**
   - Update ThemeData and color schemes
   - Migrate existing widgets to use Material 3 components
   - Ensure consistent theming across the app

2. **Phase 2: Navigation Refinement**
   - Implement AutoRoute
   - Update all navigation calls
   - Add type-safe routing

3. **Phase 3: State Management**
   - Keep AuthProvider using Provider
   - Add BLoC for:
     - Video recording/upload
     - Comedy structure editing
     - Analytics
   - Gradual migration of complex state management

4. **Phase 4: Ongoing Improvements**
   - Performance optimization
   - UX enhancements
   - New feature implementation

## Success Metrics

- Consistent UI appearance across all screens
- Type-safe navigation with reduced boilerplate
- Improved state management for complex features
- Better performance metrics
- Enhanced user experience
